# Snake

That's a basic "Snake" game written in ClojureScript. To run install
[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/#install) and then run:

```
lein figwheel
```

It will tell you to open `http://localhost:3449/` in the browser. Do that.

Change `src/snake/core.cljs` when figwheel is running and observe it being immediately
executed by browser. Source maps are enabled so you're all set.
